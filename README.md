Early draft of my portfolio page built with React, JSX, and Javascript which will showcase my journey as a learning software developer.

Routing was a real challenge for me as I didn't have much of an understanding prior to beginning this project. After referring to some class recordings, YouTube, and reviewing some other resources I was able to successfully create functioning routes.

Design was also a challenge as I struggled with how I wanted the project to look with beginner CSS skills.

With that being said, this project highlighted the skills I need to grow and sharpen in order to make a task such as this more comfortable.

There is much more to improve and add. I intend to populate more of my class projects from github via a map method, adding a footer with links to socials, as well as expanding the UI.

=======
Overall, my journey into software development has been challenging, this project included, but I've learned so much in a short amount of time and am excited to continue getting better.

Resources are primarily class recordings. I will be updating this file with more resources as I continue to refine the overall project.
