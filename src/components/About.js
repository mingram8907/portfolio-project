                <p><i>I'm currently in the process of completing a 15 week Software Engineering program at Per Scholas with a curriculum training me in the software development life cycle including programming languages with areas of focus on HTML, CSS, Javascript and React. The program additionally covers frontend and backend web development where I learned to create responsive webpages. My previous career work was spent in the finance and accounting industry where I consistently demonstrated proficient customer service skills, problem solving, maintaining a team 1st mentality, accuracy, adaptability and attention to detail to name a few. Now I'm excited to bring and utilize my prior experience in combination with my newly acquired technical skills to launch into a successful growing career in software engineering. I'm happy to discuss in more detail how I'm an excellent fit to assist you and your team in achieving its goals.</i></p>
